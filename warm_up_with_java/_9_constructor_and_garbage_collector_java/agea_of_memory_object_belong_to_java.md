  - Java has two areas of memory we care about `the stack` and `the heap`.
  - There are two types of variables: `Instance variable` and `Local variable`
  - Instance variable: variables declared `inside a class but outside any method`
  - Local variable: variable declared `inside a method including method parameter`
  
- Stack: all `methods`, `Local variables` live on the stack
- Heap: all `objects`, `Instance variables` always live on the heap.//any kinds of objects
